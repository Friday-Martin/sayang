To Keysha Vadia Rahma,

If someone asked me what these last three months look like, I would not point to a photo or a date. I would point to a screen full of small moments. A “hellooooooo” that somehow made my whole morning softer. A silly line that turned into something real. A call that made the distance feel less serious. It is funny how love can begin quietly, then one day you realize it has been growing every time you come back.

At first, we were two people meeting through words. We were learning each other, learning how to talk, learning how to laugh in the same rhythm. Then without warning, your messages started to feel like a place. A place I wanted to return to, even when I was tired. A place that made me feel lighter, even when nothing special happened that day. You became that kind of person for me.

I still remember that night when you asked, “is this confession?” and I tried to hide behind a joke, like I could protect my heart by being playful. I said, “Let’s just call this… a preview.” I acted like it was only a cute line. Yet you understood what it meant. You always understand more than I expect. And later, when I finally asked you directly, “Do you like me,” you answered with a kind of honesty that felt warm and safe. You said you felt comfortable when we were on call. That sentence stayed with me. Comfort is not a small thing. Comfort is how a relationship becomes a home.

There is a special kind of tenderness in the way you care. You encourage me when I am busy. You tell me to focus, and you say you will wait until I am not. You do not make love feel like pressure. You make it feel like support. Sometimes you say “fighting,” and it sounds like a little hand pushing me forward, like you are beside me even when you are far away. Sometimes you say sorry for things you do not need to apologize for, and I wish I could take that weight off your heart with one hug.

And you know what I love most about you? You are soft, and you are strong at the same time. You can be cute and playful, then suddenly serious in the sweetest way. You can miss me deeply and still give me space to work. You can feel emotions strongly and still choose to stay with me through them. That combination is rare. It is you.

When I look back at our messages, I see a pattern. We did not only share happy moments. We also met each other in misunderstandings, in jealousy, in that shaky feeling when a small thing feels too big. Those moments could have pushed us away. Yet they did not. They showed me something important about you and about us. You love with your whole heart, and when you feel uncertain, your heart reacts fast. You want clarity. You want reassurance. You want to feel chosen. I understand that. And I want you to know this clearly, in the simplest words I can say.

I choose you.

I also want to take care of us better. When I joke, I will be gentler and clearer, so you do not have to guess. When you feel worried, I will not make you chase peace alone. I will give you calm answers, and I will hold you through it, even if it is only through a phone. When life makes you busy or your connection becomes messy, I will not turn it into stress. I will wait with love, not with pressure. I want our love to feel safe in daily life, not only beautiful in big moments.

People talk a lot about distance like it is only painful. But our distance has also taught me something. It taught me how much I can care through small actions. It taught me how meaningful a simple “I’m home” can be. It taught me that a voice can carry comfort across oceans. It taught me that love can be built in a thousand tiny bricks, one message at a time.

Now your birthday is coming, and I keep thinking about the best gift I can give you. I will give you words, because words are how we met, and words are where our love learned to breathe. So here is my promise, written simply.

On your birthday, I want you to feel loved without doubt.
In the days after your birthday, I want you to feel loved without effort.
In the months ahead, I want you to feel loved with stability, with patience, with a future we can slowly build together.

Thank you for being my favorite notification.
Thank you for being the person who makes “normal days” feel special.
Thank you for calling me gege, for letting me call you meimei, for letting us create our own little language.
Thank you for giving me your heart, even when it trembles.
I will be careful with it. I will be gentle with it. I will keep choosing you.

Happy almost birthday, my love.
I’m proud of you. I miss you. I love you.

Always.
Your gege.
